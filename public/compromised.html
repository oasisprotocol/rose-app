    <h1>Lost your private key?</h1>
    <p>
      Please take immediate action if you suspect that the private key of the created Consensus address has been lost or compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your assets, stop using the compromised account right away. Create a new wallet in MetaMask, which will generate a new Consensus address and private key, avoiding the risk for the assets to be stolen.
